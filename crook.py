    '''When crook is given a "ready challenge", it must check that the available capacity of the archival location (i.e., the Humgen iRODS zone) exceeds that which is requested, plus a 10% threshold. For example, if a capacity of 1000 bytes is requested, crook must only respond positively if at least 1100 bytes are available.'''

    # It is not straightforward to determine the remaining space available in an iRODS zone with icommands. It can be done with iquest and a suitable query, but there is no df-equivalent; fortunately, ISG run such a script and use it to populate Graphite -- the backend used by the metrics dashboards -- which provides a RESTful interface. crook can use this interface. TODO Interface details from ISG/Graphite documentation: URL, request and response.
